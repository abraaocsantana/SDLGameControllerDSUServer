# SDL Game Controller DSU Server
DSU Server ( Cemuhook Motion Provider Protocol) for SDL gamepads

This version was hacked together in an afternoon to provide motion controls to my Steam Controller when it's on BLE Mode.
It may work with other devices supported by SDL2.

(Nowadays, most software that supports SDU also supports motion directly through SDL, but when the input goes through Steam all motion data is thrown away :( )
